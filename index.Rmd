## Direction of enquiry


---
class: middle

# Key steps 

1. What is the hypothesis ?

2. Identify groups of individuals to be studies

3. Define primary exposure & its measurement

4. Define potential confounding variables & their measurement

5. Define outcome & its measurement 

6. Analysis the data

7. Result interpretation

---
class: middle

# Defining exposure groups 


- Occupational: pilots; bus drivers; doctors; nurses; workers with a specified industrial exposure, etc. 

- Infectious: hepatitis A/B/C virus; vaccines; etc.

- Social/biological: breast feeding; stress; smoking; drinking, etc. 

---
class: middle

# Types of cohort study

- **Concurrent** Cohort Studies: new exposure data is collected on cohort members at the start of (and sometimes also during) follow-up

- **Historical** Cohort Studies: use pre-existing exposure histories that have been assembled for cohort members in the past

Choice may depends on: 

study question, logistics, costs, quality of exposure data, etc.


---
class: middle 

# Concurrent vs. Historical

- Philosophical 

    - Cohort studies are always **prospective** as they look forward from exposure to disease
    
- Cohort studies sometimes called **historical** if the use historical data on exposure and disease.


---
class: middle

# Data collection

- High degree of control over data collection (type and quality)

- Possible improved sampling of patients 

- Can be very very very time consuming

- Very very very expensive

# British Doctors Study<sup>[1]</sup>

.med[
- Groups 
    - 34439 male doctors born 1900-1930 
- Exposure 
    - Smoking history from questionnaire
- Potential confounders 
    - Height, weight, BP, alcohol, medical history, etc.
- Follow-up 
    - 1951-2001
- Outcome 
    - Death and cause of death (death certificate)
- Analysis: Rate ratio by smoking history

## Karonga Prevention Study<sup>[1]</sup>

- 197 HIV + <br> 396 HIV - <br> baseline: late 1980 
- Followed up to late 1990s
- Death rate was 93.3 per 1000 person-years in the HIV + group
- 11.3 in the initially HIV - group
- Hazard Ratio: <br> 10.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.4–15.6].

# Source of cohorts


- Electronic Healthcare database

    - Already collected
    - Can be used for most study designs
    - Very large populations
    - Little control over quality and type of information
    
---
class: middle

# Source of cohorts

-  Registries 
    
    - Prospective
    - Often used for some rare/infectious diseases, or cancer
    - Better control over data collection
    - Long to conduct
    - Expensive

# Cohort studies 

.pull-left[
Advantages: 

- Multiple outcomes
- Rare exposures 
- Less biased measure of exposure
- Population rates
- Temporal sequence
]

.pull-right[
Disadvantages: 

- Money and time consuming
- Misclassification of exposure and outcome
- Loss to follow-up
- Inefficient for rare outcomes
- Bias and confounding still matter

# Example: multiple outcomes

The Karonga Prevention Study:  A. C. Crampin et al., “Long-term follow-up of HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals in rural Malawi,” AIDS, 2002.

- Originally set up to look at leprosy (ハンセン病)

- Was adapted to study HIV, TB, and other outcomes.

# Example: rare exposures

Hiroshima and Nagasaki 

- long term follow-up of children exposed to radiation from the nuclear explosions

---
class: middle

# Example: less biased measurement of exposure 

Brain Cancer and mobile phone usage 

- Asking people with brain cancer about previous/historical use may well result in a biased assessment 

---
class: middle

# Example: temporal sequence 

Cholesterol and cancer 

- Some cancer would reduce cholesterol levels: this doesn't mean low chilesterol leads to cancer 


---
class: middle

# Example: money and time consuming

UK Biobank 

- Aims to investigate gene-environment interaction

- 500,000 sample size

- At least 10 years. 

---
class:  middle

# Example: loss to follow-up

Hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer 

- Problem that women who take HRT would be more likely to complete follow-up, 

- while those who do not take HRT would have a much lower follow-up

---
class: middle

# Issues in cohort studies

- Bias:

    - Selection of the population (representativeness)
    - Choice of comparison group <br> (healthy worker effect)
    - Ascertainment of disease status <br> (losses to follow up)
    
    
---
class: middle

# Example of bias: <br> HRT and breast cancer 

- Self-reported drug history

- People on HRT were more likely to be followed 

- Detection bias: patients on HRT more likely to attend their physician than those not, thus they were more likely to have cancer detected early


---
class: middle

# Confounding

- Confounding is about alternative explanations

- It occurs when an estimate of the association between an exposure and an outcome is mixed up with the effect of another exposure on the same outcome, and the two exposures are closely related

# Example: confounding <br> carrying a briefcase to work makes you live longer



---
class: middle

# Reverse causality 

- The association exists because having the outcome leads to the exposure. 

- The begining of a disease is not always obvious (like cancer or maybe diabetes) so we sometimes exclude outcomes within a set period of time of the study start.

# Analytical approaches - Basic

- Compare disease risk or rate in exposed cohort members with unexposed cohort members

$$
\text{Risk} = \frac{\text{N of observed cases}}{\text{N at risk at start}}
$$

$$
\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{N of observed cases}}{\text{Person years at risk}}
$$

# Risk and Rate

$$
\text{Risk} = \frac{2}{7} = 0.29 
$$

$$
\text{Rate} = \frac{2}{2 + 1.5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1.5 + 1} = \frac{2}{10}
$$

$\Rightarrow 0.2$ deaths/person-year 


---
class: middle

# SMR - standardized mortality (morbiditiy) ratio

$$
\text{SMR} = \frac{\text{Observed Deaths}}{\text{Expected Deaths}} = \frac{O}{E}
$$

Expected deaths are the number of deaths that would be expected if age-, sex-, and calendar period rates for the **general population**.

## Analysis: a simplified example <br> British Doctors Study Lung cancer rates

- Exposed: current smokers, more than 24 cigarettes/day <br> Rate = 4.17 / 1000 men-year

# Interpretation

- Consider possibility of bias, residual confounding

- One study alone not proof

- Consistent evidence with the other cohorts/study designs in differen settings.

- RCT is not always possible
