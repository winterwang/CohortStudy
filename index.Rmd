# Cohort

"Any designated group of individuals who are followed or traced over a period of time." --- Rothman 1998

## Direction of enquiry


---
class: middle

# Key steps 

1. What is the hypothesis ?

2. Identify groups of individuals to be studies

3. Define primary exposure & its measurement

4. Define potential confounding variables & their measurement

5. Define outcome & its measurement 

6. Analysis the data

7. Result interpretation

---
class: middle

# Defining exposure groups 


- Occupational: pilots; bus drivers; doctors; nurses; workers with a specified industrial exposure, etc. 

- Infectious: hepatitis A/B/C virus; vaccines; etc.

- Social/biological: breast feeding; stress; smoking; drinking, etc. 

---
class: middle

# Types of cohort study

- **Concurrent** Cohort Studies: new exposure data is collected on cohort members at the start of (and sometimes also during) follow-up

- **Historical** Cohort Studies: use pre-existing exposure histories that have been assembled for cohort members in the past

Choice may depends on: 

study question, logistics, costs, quality of exposure data, etc.


---
class: middle 

# Concurrent vs. Historical

- Philosophical 

    - Cohort studies are always **prospective** as they look forward from exposure to disease
    
- Cohort studies sometimes called **historical** if the use historical data on exposure and disease.


---
class: middle

# Data collection

- High degree of control over data collection (type and quality)

- Possible improved sampling of patients 

- Can be very very very time consuming

- Very very very expensive

# British Doctors Study<sup>[1]</sup>

.med[
- Groups 
    - 34439 male doctors born 1900-1930 
- Exposure 
    - Smoking history from questionnaire
- Potential confounders 
    - Height, weight, BP, alcohol, medical history, etc.
- Follow-up 
    - 1951-2001
- Outcome 
    - Death and cause of death (death certificate)
- Analysis: Rate ratio by smoking history

## Karonga Prevention Study<sup>[1]</sup>

- 197 HIV + <br> 396 HIV - <br> baseline: late 1980 
- Followed up to late 1990s
- Death rate was 93.3 per 1000 person-years in the HIV + group
- 11.3 in the initially HIV - group
- Hazard Ratio: <br> 10.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.4–15.6].

# Source of cohorts


- Electronic Healthcare database

    - Already collected
    - Can be used for most study designs
    - Very large populations
    - Little control over quality and type of information
    
---
class: middle

# Source of cohorts

-  Registries 
    
    - Prospective
    - Often used for some rare/infectious diseases, or cancer
    - Better control over data collection
    - Long to conduct
    - Expensive

# Cohort studies 

.pull-left[
Advantages: 

- Multiple outcomes
- Rare exposures 
- Less biased measure of exposure
- Population rates
- Temporal sequence
]

.pull-right[
Disadvantages: 

- Money and time consuming
- Misclassification of exposure and outcome
- Loss to follow-up
- Inefficient for rare outcomes
- Bias and confounding still matter

# Example: multiple outcomes

The Karonga Prevention Study:  A. C. Crampin et al., “Long-term follow-up of HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals in rural Malawi,” AIDS, 2002.

- Originally set up to look at leprosy (ハンセン病)

- Was adapted to study HIV, TB, and other outcomes.

# Example: rare exposures

Hiroshima and Nagasaki 

- long term follow-up of children exposed to radiation from the nuclear explosions

---
class: middle

# Example: less biased measurement of exposure 

Brain Cancer and mobile phone usage 

- Asking people with brain cancer about previous/historical use may well result in a biased assessment 

---
class: middle

# Example: temporal sequence 

Cholesterol and cancer 

- Some cancer would reduce cholesterol levels: this doesn't mean low chilesterol leads to cancer 


---
class: middle

# Example: money and time consuming

UK Biobank 

- Aims to investigate gene-environment interaction

- 500,000 sample size

- At least 10 years. 

---
class:  middle

# Example: loss to follow-up

Hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer 

- Problem that women who take HRT would be more likely to complete follow-up, 

- while those who do not take HRT would have a much lower follow-up

# Issues in cohort studies

- Bias:

    - Selection of the population (representativeness)
    - Choice of comparison group <br> (healthy worker effect)
